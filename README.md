# BradOS
Note: The .iso files are acting a little weird compared to the straight bin file.
I'd recommend using the bin file.

# How to use the bin and ISO file?

I use qemu, so go ahead and instead qemu.

If you're using the kernel.bin type:

`qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel.bin`

If you're using the BradOS V X.X.X type:

`qemu-system-i386 -cdrom BradOS V X.X.X.iso`

# How do I use the operating system?

The "help" command is quite useful. As is the Changelog file. 

## What's the password?

"password"
