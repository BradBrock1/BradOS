* Bug Fix
: Note 	

V 0.0.1: 31/10/2015
	: First build of BradOS
		: Features 2 Commands - cls & exit
V 0.0.2: Unknown - No ISO build?
	+ Added "help" command
	** Renamed "cls" command to "clear"
	** Change type of shutdown from void to int - Produces less errors/warnings (for me anyways, not for the user)
	* Fixed an issue but I don't remember what it is

V 0.0.3: 27/05/2016
	+ Included "stdbool.h"
	+ Included a check to see if interrupts are enabled
	
V 0.0.4: 27/05/2016
	+ Added the option for the user to enable interrupts
	+ Added the option for the user to disable interrupts

V 0.0.5: 27/05/2016
	+/** Added/Changed welcome text 
		+ Added a diss
	** Changed the colour of the welcome text
	* Fixed an issue where when the user tries to enable or disable interrupts the text telling them if it's successful appears on one line.

V 0.0.6: 27/05/2016
	+ Added a reboot command. Unsure if working or not though.

V 0.0.7: 28/05/2016
	+ Added login feature.
	: Confirmed reboot works
	: Cannot currently enable interrupts (well you can but an error will occur, causing the OS to reboot). 

V 0.0.8: 29/05/2016
	+ Added exception handling!
		: Not going to list them though! :P
	: Turns out the reboot was actually just an error, making the OS reboot. Now that exception handling is here, rebooting isn't possible :(

V 0.0.9: 29/05/2016
	+ Added version checking
	+ Added nothing command
	+ Added noppity command
	+ Added version command
	+ Added new exit command
	** Changed iso creation software -- now bootable! (at least on qemu)
	** Changed exit command to shutdown
	** Changed shutdown text	
	** Changed login system
	** Changed command text to include username
	** Updated help command
	* Fixed spelling mistake in welcoming text
	: Note. Shutdown command and exit command seem to be working since the CPU usage goes from 100% to 0%.

V 0.0.10: 31/05/2016
	+ Included application closing function (if exit code isn't 0 and the program wants to log the issue, will write a program error to the system event (when implemented of course...)(this code still runs when a program is closed however) or to a terminal output, or both. Currently running as a test, will try to implement it when catching errors (other than ISR)). 
	+ Added support for numpad /,*,- and + to be used.
	** Changed Shutdown text to show a more accurate representation of what's going on.
	* Fixed help command not showing shorthand for some commands
	* Fixed help command missing a character for the exit command
	* [Major] Fixed an issue where extra spaces needed to be added in order to render text properly as well as read it.
	* Clear command now removes the initial newline when re-asking for input

V 0.0.11: 01/06/2016
	+ Added username function so you can change username
	+ Added password system. 
		: password is password.
	+ Added very simple encryption system.
	+ Added copy command which copies a block of memory which contains the "password" variable to the block of memory which contains the "output" variable, then prints the output variable to the screen.
	** Changed how the shutdown works. Now just crashes the OS. This is a temp fix until I can work out how to actually shut down the PC.
	** Improved readability of help
	** Changed the reboot command. Now falls back to an earlier state. This is a temp fix until I can work out how to actually reboot the OS.
	* Fixed an issue where the clear command doesn't add any newlines when asking for input

V 0.0.12: 03/06/2016
	+ Added the ability to write to COM1
	** Changed the text after logging in to warn users of the clear command being a little buggy.
	** Changed the way the command text is rendered (username@bradOS)
	** Changed welcome string to include version
	** Changed welcoming string to include name
	* Fixed an issue with the username
	* Fixed an issue with values being overwritten (only in the login part though(so far))
	* Fixed an issue where when rebooting, some video memory is overwritten
	* Fixed an issue where when rebooting, entering any password would work since the password was already accepted (since the OS doesn't reboot, it just goes back to the main method)
	: All these fixes now means that shutdown via crashing the OS no longer works, and also displays the password at the end for some reason :s
	: Now is more likely to have a "bad command" when entering commands, however, after a little bit of testing, this only really happens after you've cleared the screen. Before doing that they aren't as often. Problems with reading input :/ ... it's lead to a number of issues :(

V 0.0.13: 
	+ Added a virtual file system (though I'll probably remove once I get disk I/O figured out)
	+ Added a virtual file called "example.brd", which you can "run"
	+ Added four commands to navigate the virtual file system
		+ Added cdup (change directory up)
		+ Added cddown (change directory down)
		+ Added cd (current directory) -- basically tells you your current directory
		+ Added ls -- lists the files in the current directory
	** Changed colour of initial welcome text to a deeper green
	** Removed the text warning users that the clear command is a little buggy.
	** Updated help menu to make the copy command slightly more readable. 
		: Commands such as copy and what-not will be removed in later versions or just hidden from the help menu.
	* [Major] Fixed the issue where entering correct commands would say they are incorrect
		: This also means pressing enter will just go to a new line instead of spamming "bad command" :)
	: Username is a little broken, especially when changing it :s
	: Stress tested this version. From 14:52 -> 22:00 and it worked perfectly. Started at 60c, and ended at 59c (in qemu).

V 0.0.14:
	+ Added a feature to check if memory is free or not.
	** Changed the reboot code so now it actually reboots instead of re-calling the main method!
	** Changed "@Brad OS>" to "@BradOS>"
	** Changed introduction text to include ascii art.
	** Changed the way exceptions are handled
		: Included BSOD similarity.
	* Fixed spelling issue in one of the exception messages
		: Also removed a few unnecessary spaces in all exception messages, saving bytes of space.
	- Removed a piece of code which would clear certain memory addresses which did not need clearing.
	- Removed checking for interrupts at startup.

V 0.0.15:
	+ Added stars to password so you can enter the super encrypted password without anyone seeing it.
	** Changed the way exceptions look 
		: Now look badass, thanks to the following improvement
	** Changed how text is rendered
		: Now supports colours!
	** Changed the look of the OS
		: Changed the entire colour of the OS
		: Changed the username@BradOS> to resemble a more Linux like colour scheme
	** Changed the help text so it no longer says that the reboot code doesn't work and is simulated.
	* Fixed issue where changing username wouldn't work
	* Fixed an issue where when changing username, the old username would remain (when displaying username, not actually storing the value)
	- Removed copy command 
		** Updated help
	* Fixed a few warnings that GCC was throwing up

Known issues:
It's actually better than Windows.
Can delete the initial input line.
The .iso produced behaves differently from the .bin

Notes:
Username can be whatever. Password is password.
Single developer m8.
Developed using qemu as my emulator. Used virtualbox from time to time. There are differences, thus running on a PC will most likely produce different results. This is bad since I can't manage 3 systems at once, but is good because it means my OS is complex enough for it to happen :D



Running the .bin vs the .iso produce different results

Release dates for V 0.0.11 and before are all based on the system image, so they might not be 100% correct.
BradOS V 0.0.2 seems to be missing.
